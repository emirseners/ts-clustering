    """
    Calculate pairwise pattern distances between all data sequences using Dynamic Time Warping.
    
    The distance measures the proximity of data series in terms of their 
    qualitative pattern features. In other words, it quantifies the proximity 
    between two different dynamic behaviour modes by allowing for time warping.

    Parameters
    ----------
    list_of_ts_objects : List['TimeSeries']
        List of TimeSeries objects.

    distance_kwargs : dict, default={}

        Dictionary of keyword arguments for the distance calculation:

        ``significanceLevel`` : float, default=0.01
            Threshold value (as a fraction) for filtering out insignificant fluctuations in 
            slope and curvature calculations. Values below this threshold relative to the
            data magnitude are considered noise and set to zero.
        ``wSlopeError`` : float, default=1.0
            Weight applied to slope dimension errors when calculating feature vector distances.
        ``wCurvatureError`` : float, default=1.0
            Weight applied to curvature dimension errors when calculating feature vector distances.

    Returns
    -------
    dRow : np.ndarray
        Condensed distance matrix as 1D array of length n_samples * (n_samples - 1) / 2.
    list_of_ts_objects : List['TimeSeries']
