**Usage Note**

The functions in this module are primarily used internally by:
* :mod:`simgon.distance_pattern` - for behavioral feature extraction
* :mod:`simgon.distance_pattern_dtw` - for behavioral feature extraction with DTW

End users typically don't need to call these functions directly, but they can access the source code to understand how behavioral features are extracted and processed.
