Installation
===========

Installing via pip
-----------------

To install the clusterer package from the Python package index use the pip command:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install clusterer

Installing with conda
--------------------

To install clusterer with conda, using the conda-forge channel, use the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

   conda install -c conda-forge clusterer

Installing from source
---------------------

To install from source, clone the project with git:

.. code-block:: bash

   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ts-clustering.git

or download the latest version from the project repository.

In the source directory use the command:

.. code-block:: bash

   python setup.py install

Required Dependencies
-------------------

Clusterer requires **Python 3.9** or above.

Clusterer builds on the core Python data analytics stack, and the following third party libraries:

* Numpy >= 1.24.0
* Scipy >= 1.16.0
* Matplotlib >= 3.7.0
* Pandas >= 2.0.0
* PySD >= 3.0.0
* Numba >= 0.57.0

These modules should build automatically if you are installing via pip. If you are building from source, or if pip fails to load them, they can be loaded with the same pip syntax as above.

Optional Dependencies
--------------------

For enhanced plotting capabilities:

* Matplotlib (already included in core dependencies)

For additional data export capabilities:

* XlsxWriter >= 3.0.0 (for Excel export functionality)

For advanced time series analysis:

* Scikit-learn (for additional clustering algorithms)
* NetworkX (for network-based clustering)

These modules can be installed using pip with a syntax similar to the above.

Additional Resources
------------------

The documentation contains examples and API references that can help you get started with clusterer.

For development and contribution:

* Sphinx >= 7.0 (for building documentation)
* Sphinx-autodoc-typehints >= 2.0 (for type hint documentation)
* Sphinx-rtd-theme >= 2.0 (for documentation theme)
